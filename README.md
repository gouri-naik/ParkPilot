# ParkPilot
Safe and effective parking is becoming a serious problem in contemporary urban living areas because of crowded parking spaces and poor visibility. The intelligent driver-assistance systems are also on high demand, especially on low-speed manipulation within narrow spaces. ParkPilot is a solution based on the work of the embedded system, which is aimed at helping drivers identify obstacles and keep safe distances when parking. This project will also reduce human error in the operation of parking by integrating ultrasonic sensing with visual and audio feedback to ensure increased safety.

This system is designed to combine ultrasonic distance sensor HC-SR04 with ARM Cortex-M3 LPC1768 microcontroller, 16×2 LCD display, 8 LED indicators, 7-segment display, and a buzzer to give real-time distance value and alerts. The microcontroller compares the time gap between the sent and received ultrasonic pulses in order to calculate the distance of the obstacles that are in the way. The findings are put on the LCD screen and the buzzer sounds audio warning, and LEDs give visual warning according to proximity. Intelligent parking timer and automated billing system to track the time parked and calculate the charge are also designed in the design demonstrating the practical use of embedded systems in automating smart parking.

The experimental findings show that ParkPilot has a high level of accuracy in identifying obstacles within the range of 2 cm to 400 cm and provides the user with multi-layered audio and visual feedback. The system has successfully alerted the driver about possible collisions with three level warning (SAFE, WARNING, STOP) to make sure that parking is safer and less likely to damage a vehicle. Automated billing will be useful because it monitors reports on parking time and charges according to time. Therefore, the project draws the attention to the fact that embedded systems can be used to develop intelligent safety-oriented automotive solutions.
